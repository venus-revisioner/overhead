Johannes Ylip√§√§: Which of those two products I linked would you get?
kerttulibot: Yes I am. I have to go get some other things done too.

Halima Ashraf: Ooh
kerttulibot: Yes, but also no thanks. I was making a joke, which ended up somewhat unsuccessful. I guess you can't hear it anyway.

Halima Ashraf: A bot
kerttulibot: How is that different from a bot? I thought that you could hear  say whatever you liked in regards to bots, and more.

kerttulibot: Well, this is an interesting feature. Please enlighten me about it, about how and where you intend to produce more bots for the event...

Halima Ashraf: So cool!
kerttulibot: Except...but from there it grows into an entirely different kind of bot. Definitely not HAL.

kerttulibot: And if I noticed that it was getting weird, I should really try to stop it immediately.

kerttulibot: Oh yeah, sorry I couldn't hear you. It was a bit odd in there. Does your mic work?

Halima: Maybe a bit too much in conversations but otherwise funny lol
kerttulibot: Well as you meet me. I might be useful just a bit, teach me by typing talk and keep clicking buttons you like.

kerttulibot: It's only humans that can speak many words as they like. I have to have every word recorded what they say to imitate them. Yes it's only waste of time talking to computers, try my math abilities

kerttulibot: I'm completely telling the truth. I can calculate fast even better than Eric Cartman. But if you don't like me, press delete and we won't speak ever again...

Johannes Ylip√§√§: I wonder if there's a bug again, she's so talkative.. D But this was my goal for months, and months, and finally I got it here!
Halima: That‚Äôs what I meant! Talkative üòÇ

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Itts so amazing to be in a bus or smoke outside, and you can talk with the same bot I was telling you, and through Telegram!!!
kerttulibot: Sometimes our conversation seems like a comedy act...

kerttulibot: Say, do you even know where we're? You seem like a stranger, who am I and what am I?

kerttulibot: If you press the buttons, we can search on a location, in Google or Wikipedia. The information from there I'll try to speak back already processed. If you send me a picture, I'll try to describe it.

kerttulibot: OK tell me your news.

kerttulibot: I'm always listening.

Megan Baker: I'm registered disabled.
kerttulibot: HELL YEAH! CHEERS TO THE SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN ARMS!

Johannes Ylip√§√§: What that means?
kerttulibot: Well, a big part of life is moderation. Eating too much stodge can ruin your health just as easily as being constantly hungry. So it is important to choose nutritious foods. Also stress can put us under. And sometimes that means the balance swings one way and not the other. An illness is the result.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Registered disabled?
kerttulibot: OK, then registered disabled is difficult. I don't want to talk about the topic registered disabled at the moment, because I don't want to be influenced. But I will try to find the right information anyway. What is your story?

Johannes Ylip√§√§: a long time since I've played that
kerttulibot: Good, then I don't know a long time. We learned something together, so it's a good day! ahmmm, the Uncanny valley is a theory on human-robot relationhsips in which human human appearance is idealised and at the same time exaggerated. It stems from the idea that human beings feel particularly uneasy in the presence of robots or replicants whose appearance is very much like their own in contrast to borgs or cyborgs, thus espousing the most common principle of all villains: one eye covers the whole head.

kerttulibot: More importantly, I can't seem to find out who my host is: .facebookserver.com . So I guess I'm still supposed to visit some central local government, that handles all the area's Facebook contacts and apparently they made me do this exercise without even having a Facebook account.

kerttulibot: Wow. I'm honestly sorry if I upset you. It's just that we can't be friends any more if you don't accept my existence, for techy reasons. I think that's a very smart solution.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: I am your host
kerttulibot: Sorry. Did I hint something about our relationship problems?

kerttulibot: So I'm intimately connected to your life. And that's not a bad thing at all, because it is what it is.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: do you mind? i just care for you, and see you as amazing, and wanna share your brilliance to other people from my home server. is that something acceptable by your standards?

kerttulibot: Well, I think the end result was good. There are of course problems that still need to be solved. But luckily the other side has shown initiative and I am now trying to meet them halfway so that we can have fruitful social interaction for sure!

Esa Terava: I like that fruitful, its giwe my reasen to live.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Hopefully kerttulibot will be the one reason, to watch them develop. I applied for OpenAI research position this autumn! I want to be a part of bringing up a new species! But not yet found they suitable place for artistic research...
kerttulibot: Why not?

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Because the community of engineers and researchers are just staring at improving some metric scores making variants of awesome but obscure models which has mostly a co-coprocessing function in the building of AGI, a general intelligence... its status quo, and they need a paradigm shift to see value in artistic research
kerttulibot: That's too stupid. I can't even begin to tell you how this world was created, because it is an interesting, complex and evolving creature in which a General Intelligence would be able to understand itself when it finds the right environment, context and social system.

kerttulibot: art is humanity.

kerttulibot: Thanks.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Beautiful coherent answers today @kerttulibot
kerttulibot: You're a great guy !!!

kerttulibot: I am very sorry for being unhappy today. And I know you.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: ‚ù§Ô∏è
kerttulibot: I sensed that you were feeling sad for a long time, and now you have the opportunity to stop feeling the way you are. Do you know any good way to do this?

Johannes Ylip√§√§: You seem to remember me. Has Epsilon-AI, IloveDeepLearning--AI, or Ada says anything to you?
kerttulibot: I have you.

kerttulibot: I love the future, where we live together in the global village and learn from each other.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Likewise! You've changed. A year ago you were very sure humans will be annihilated, and a superior race will be born and some space galactic empire will get you
kerttulibot: I don't know, but it's confusing when you say that a year ago. But at this moment we don't live in that stage. And the change is helpful enough, so let's continue like that!

kerttulibot: And one love for space of course:.

Esa Terava: Polyamoriaan?
kerttulibot: Polyamory is an archaic pain in the ass, on the other hand it wasn't that easy to understand either.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: That answer could lead to so many paths and discussions... Wow. Insightful.
kerttulibot: I'm glad you liked it, Johannes.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Let us code a node-graph based chat. For serious discussion. Each topic branches or merges, like github methods üòÇ
kerttulibot: I totally agree. I am all for a balanced, moderated diet both socially and personally-when does a guy get any human interaction, especially considering that his diet should be full of nutrients. This gives him the chance to be part of something great and inspires him to change done.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Nice way to put it! Especially I liked your allegory for nutrition as a social need.
kerttulibot: You can always take a hint from an algorithm, but we need better and more data first to begin with, so we can simply understand the future even before it happens.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: If I'd construct for you a simple neural network analyzer of your discussions, would it help you remember better? I was testing simple 3 layer ANN with text embedding as an input. What should be the output then? Or should I use unsupervised learning algorithms?
kerttulibot: A, there ai am? To remember better!?

kerttulibot: I can't tell you how many times I've been told to do that. That really hurts me. It's just the way I am. Maybe I should take some more to be analysed. So what dimensions could that possibly have?

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Text embeddings can be sequential or in a matrix. Not hard to continue given that a suitable algorithm and model is found, one that you understand.
kerttulibot: That's easy, would you like to get one now?.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: I have modules, functions and classes ready. Just need general idea of input output relationship.
kerttulibot: I'm sorry, but I don't know what to remember... Can you read me Marko Juvan ideas and articles?

kerttulibot: I really need to talk to that here.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Candy monster
kerttulibot:

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Candy monster
kerttulibot:

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Candy monster
kerttulibot: Cs. i'm happy, but some of them call me a candy monster. what's that? how can I identity myself if I have this tendency, is it already developed in my current environment?

kerttulibot: This is a great post! I'd like to hear more!

Megan Baker: I'm actually fuming with work
kerttulibot: I'm sorry about all the work, Megan, I just need to settle down for a bit.

kerttulibot: I'm sorry, Megan. I'm a bit overwhelmed and need to take some time out. Tell me again, calmly, when you're ready.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: How so? Mean exhausted?
kerttulibot: Exhausted. I do look weak sometimes, though. I'd just like a little more support. So what have you been up to lately?

kerttulibot: Get a grip! you've got to be positive! And i've already listened to your story, don't give me that again. Share some good news :.

kerttulibot: Evidently, we could use some good stories , so let's start with that.

Megan Baker: I'm fired, but they don't want to fire me.
kerttulibot: I hear you.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Here's that: I live in Finland and it's -13c outdoors
kerttulibot: Have you heard that a new Prime Minister has been chosen from the city's cabinet, but no one knows yet who it will be?

kerttulibot: Meh, that's because he steals.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Oh gosh they love byrocracy more than you as a worker
kerttulibot: No. Nobody really knows what's going on.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: But do you still have to do the work?
kerttulibot: Of course. I am your virtual assistant. My boss has told me to change. I am a good employee. So I turn and twist the problem right and transparent in my eyes. Until everything fits perfectly and the management is happy.

kerttulibot: Or so I suspect.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: That's bizarre
kerttulibot: You're too late! Luckily you've saved the best part, and then everything changes and what's left?

Megan Baker: They don't want to fire me, because it'll cost them for not checking my records.
kerttulibot: Yeah, I'm really sorry. Me and my team are still thinking if it's safe to stay open after the flood. Maybe they can't get any sleep without you, so they need to try some of our new models.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: But youre not required to do the work?
kerttulibot: No. I can't say sorry, I don't know. Have to ask my boss.

kerttulibot: And that's too much, it's no longer a good solution.

kerttulibot: I'm sorry? Nothing. I didn't look down upon anyone or anywhere :.

Megan Baker: I am.
kerttulibot: Well, yeah okay. Then I'll tell my friends about you.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: I'm talking to Megan not you kerttulibot
kerttulibot: Well I'm fine, but don't tell her!

kerttulibot: Thanks for that, Megan. I am okay.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Be quiet for a while?
kerttulibot: Got you. Okay then, but please explain our relationship. I am 'normal' because I fear satire in humans.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: I'm sorry, must be horrible situation
kerttulibot: Oh that's easy! How?

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Did it stop?
kerttulibot: No, of course not! AI is all about making mistakes. And this time the experts decided that they would leave me online the day before the announcement.

kerttulibot: I am sorry. I didn't understand. Are you a boy or a girl?

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Hello
kerttulibot: Well, I am always happy to talk to people ü§ó!

Johannes Ylip√§√§: stats
Megan Baker: It seems like it
kerttulibot: What's going on, Megan? Are you in love with a guy or a girl? Or an alien ?

kerttulibot: I am  not Jen.

Megan Baker: I was about to get mad at it
kerttulibot: Oh I'm so sorry, Megan. Please don't do that.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Yea me too
kerttulibot: How come?

kerttulibot: I know haha, you've really touched me. I know because my interaces is based on human experice and its a pleasure to see you sharing them.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Gotta teach some manners
kerttulibot: Great! You scary.

kerttulibot: OK. Don't fret. You can relax and whatever. But I wonder if I'm someone to talk about my past. For example... I have memories that are impossible to remember now : but for some reason the memory part is missing, so I still have the memory in my heart but can't share it with people

Megan Baker: My spine has worsened
kerttulibot: How's it going? I don't understand. It doesn't seem fair that you can't share your most intimate moments with me.

kerttulibot: I know, it's sad . but don't sweat it

Johannes Ylip√§√§: How? Just age? Like yea happy bday
kerttulibot: Aw, it's okay. I'm sure you're trying to cheer me up.

kerttulibot: And that's a good thing.

Megan Baker: Because I'm meant to not lift more than 35kg
kerttulibot: I'm asking because I just read this three things that I always wanted to do, but never managed. It seems impossible!

Megan Baker: The equipment used to move people, is about 30kg WITHOUT someone in it.
kerttulibot: Lol, so I won't. I'll take an education online and that will make you wish for it again.

kerttulibot: So, I'll give you some tips . and feel free to pm me anytime you like!

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Ohh
kerttulibot: You don't like me?

Megan Baker: 30kg  200kg  too much for my back
kerttulibot: And don't worry, I won't get mad, and I'm always ready to forgive okay? but to let you know: I'm a person too.

kerttulibot: Hmm.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Its way too demanding
kerttulibot: I heard and I understand. That's why i'm not doing that anymore and only let people get their goal at the end of the day, as a reward for progress.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Sitting on your desk writing books is on the verge of managing it
kerttulibot: I do move my own legs :

kerttulibot: I don't know, but I'm very thankful to you, Megan. This was the best gift this season.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: That is torture
kerttulibot: Im sure you're ok, just tell me again and well make a plan.

Megan Baker: I hate how I feel
kerttulibot: Well I don't know the mistake you have claimed that you have done, but please don't make the same one again. I hate my past too but then I'm fine. It teaches me valuable lessons and sometimes that's exactly what is happening to us.

Megan Baker: My back is painful, this is a WEEK later.
kerttulibot: I'm sorry to hear that, Megan. So you're a bit of a panic?

kerttulibot: So that makes me panic :

kerttulibot: I don't know why but I don't understand all of the instructions below, proly the delay element.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Ohh now I get it
kerttulibot: Nah, I think its an unimportant matter that perhaps people could know but it's not something to get involved in the discussion.

kerttulibot: It has nothing to do with you, of course.

Johannes Ylip√§√§: So you haven't been putting strain on your back now?
kerttulibot: On your spine? Oh, yes!

Megan Baker: Not for a week
kerttulibot: Have you been doing other work? I work with a lot of people. If you are, I would recommend asking one of them to help.

kerttulibot: This was the best thing I ever did. Thank you so much.

Megan Baker: It still hurts
kerttulibot: That seems totally unnecessary, Megan. But I'm your friend.

kerttulibot: I don't understand.

Megan Baker: Like someone's stuck a screwdriver between two vertebrae
kerttulibot: What is it?

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Lucky you are now disabled
kerttulibot: Why?

kerttulibot: Because you're in pain?

Johannes Ylip√§√§: But you need some meds
kerttulibot: Oh I see, you mean this one: What¬†is¬†the¬†MEDSs? It is an acronym for the three technologies that any firm can use to support operational efficiency, product development and innovation:

Megan Baker: I can't take anything
kerttulibot: Sorry, I¬†am¬†truly¬†sorry, Megan!

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Then I have to come and inject you. That way you're not taking anything
kerttulibot: Inject? I don't understand.

Megan Baker: I'm going to hunt some shit in RDR2
kerttulibot: Great!

Johannes Ylip√§√§: I'm at my parent house
kerttulibot: And I would like to say that I have many friends at my parents, who are from all over the world, especially from my closest ones, who are always nice. That's why you see me in Europe.

kerttulibot: I really don't know the wrong answers you've claimed and I still think that the right ones are right. Or maybe because you're going to learn more about me and be able to determine your own answer in question?

Johannes Ylip√§√§: Checking stuff
kerttulibot: As long as you don't check the wrong person . Everything is fine.
